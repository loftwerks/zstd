use hashbrown::hash_map as base;

/// A hash map implemented with quadratic probing and SIMD lookup.
///
/// By default, `HashMap` uses a hashing algorithm selected to provide
/// resistance against HashDoS attacks. The algorithm is randomly seeded, and a
/// reasonable best-effort is made to generate this seed from a high quality,
/// secure source of randomness provided by the host without blocking the
/// program. Because of this, the randomness of the seed depends on the output
/// quality of the system's random number generator when the seed is created.
/// In particular, seeds generated when the system's entropy pool is abnormally
/// low such as during system boot may be of a lower quality.
///
/// The default hashing algorithm is currently SipHash 1-3, though this is
/// subject to change at any point in the future. While its performance is very
/// competitive for medium sized keys, other hashing algorithms will outperform
/// it for small keys such as integers as well as large keys such as long
/// strings, though those algorithms will typically *not* protect against
/// attacks such as HashDoS.
///
/// The hashing algorithm can be replaced on a per-`HashMap` basis using the
/// [`default`], [`with_hasher`], and [`with_capacity_and_hasher`] methods. Many
/// alternative algorithms are available on crates.io, such as the [`fnv`] crate.
///
/// It is required that the keys implement the [`Eq`] and [`Hash`] traits, although
/// this can frequently be achieved by using `#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]`.
/// If you implement these yourself, it is important that the following
/// property holds:
///
/// ```text
/// k1 == k2 -> hash(k1) == hash(k2)
/// ```
///
/// In other words, if two keys are equal, their hashes must be equal.
///
/// It is a logic error for a key to be modified in such a way that the key's
/// hash, as determined by the [`Hash`] trait, or its equality, as determined by
/// the [`Eq`] trait, changes while it is in the map. This is normally only
/// possible through [`Cell`], [`RefCell`], global state, I/O, or unsafe code.
///
/// The hash table implementation is a Rust port of Google's [SwissTable].
/// The original C++ version of SwissTable can be found [here], and this
/// [CppCon talk] gives an overview of how the algorithm works.
///

/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use std::collections::HashMap;
///
/// // Type inference lets us omit an explicit type signature (which
/// // would be `HashMap<String, String>` in this example).
/// let mut book_reviews = HashMap::new();
///
/// // Review some books.
/// book_reviews.insert(
///     "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn".to_string(),
///     "My favorite book.".to_string(),
/// );
/// book_reviews.insert(
///     "Grimms' Fairy Tales".to_string(),
///     "Masterpiece.".to_string(),
/// );
/// book_reviews.insert(
///     "Pride and Prejudice".to_string(),
///     "Very enjoyable.".to_string(),
/// );
/// book_reviews.insert(
///     "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes".to_string(),
///     "Eye lyked it alot.".to_string(),
/// );
///
/// // Check for a specific one.
/// // When collections store owned values (String), they can still be
/// // queried using references (&str).
/// if !book_reviews.contains_key("Les Misérables") {
///     println!("We've got {} reviews, but Les Misérables ain't one.",
///              book_reviews.len());
/// }
///
/// // oops, this review has a lot of spelling mistakes, let's delete it.
/// book_reviews.remove("The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes");
///
/// // Look up the values associated with some keys.
/// let to_find = ["Pride and Prejudice", "Alice's Adventure in Wonderland"];
/// for &book in &to_find {
///     match book_reviews.get(book) {
///         Some(review) => println!("{}: {}", book, review),
///         None => println!("{} is unreviewed.", book)
///     }
/// }
///
/// // Look up the value for a key (will panic if the key is not found).
/// println!("Review for Jane: {}", book_reviews["Pride and Prejudice"]);
///
/// // Iterate over everything.
/// for (book, review) in &book_reviews {
///     println!("{}: \"{}\"", book, review);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// `HashMap` also implements an [`Entry API`](#method.entry), which allows
/// for more complex methods of getting, setting, updating and removing keys and
/// their values:
///
/// ```
/// use std::collections::HashMap;
///
/// // type inference lets us omit an explicit type signature (which
/// // would be `HashMap<&str, u8>` in this example).
/// let mut player_stats = HashMap::new();
///
/// fn random_stat_buff() -> u8 {
///     // could actually return some random value here - let's just return
///     // some fixed value for now
///     42
/// }
///
/// // insert a key only if it doesn't already exist
/// player_stats.entry("health").or_insert(100);
///
/// // insert a key using a function that provides a new value only if it
/// // doesn't already exist
/// player_stats.entry("defence").or_insert_with(random_stat_buff);
///
/// // update a key, guarding against the key possibly not being set
/// let stat = player_stats.entry("attack").or_insert(100);
/// *stat += random_stat_buff();
/// ```
///
/// The easiest way to use `HashMap` with a custom key type is to derive [`Eq`] and [`Hash`].
/// We must also derive [`PartialEq`].
